Rules:
- Tap on black tiles to turn them white
- Every tile is randomly assigned to trigger another tile to turn black
- Figure out the pattern to solve the game!

To do:
- option to make game objective changing white to black
- levels of increasing difficulty (4x4, 5x5, etc.)
- use hash map to ensure solvability of each board
- port to iOS and Android as a minigame

Inspiration:
- Inspired by an antiquated ticket selling console at a nifty old movie theater. Whenever one button in the array was pushed, another would pop up!
